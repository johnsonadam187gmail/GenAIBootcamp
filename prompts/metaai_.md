    |garbage	|malmōt	  |mahl-moh-t
    |out	    |valtiro  |vahl-tee-roh

    Possible Sentence Structure
    Valyrian sentence structure often follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. Let's look at an example sentence:
    "Zhaēs drakon valtiro." (You put it out.)
    Breakdown:
    Zhaēs (You) - subject
    drakon (put) - verb
    valtiro (out) - object
    In this example, the sentence structure is SVO. For your sentence, you might need to use a similar structure, but with additional words and possibly different verb conjugations.
    Clues for Particles and Conjugations
    Valyrian uses cases to indicate grammatical function. You might need to use different cases for "door" and "garbage" depending on their roles in the sentence.
    Valyrian verbs change depending on tense and mood. You'll need to determine the correct conjugation for "are" and "did put".
    Pronunciation Guide
    Valyrian words often use a mix of soft and hard consonant sounds. Pay attention to the phonetic pronunciations provided in the vocabulary table.
